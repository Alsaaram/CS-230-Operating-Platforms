# CS-230-Operating-Platforms
- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a company that was looking to expand its game services onto various operating platforms to grow its overall user base. They wanted us to design a piece of software that would allow cross-functionality between different types of platforms.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In the development of the documentation, I believed that I was thorough enough to answer the vital questions as well as explaining the differences between features that were available to implement, so the company could make an educated decision.

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Going through the design document step by step really helps with the code writing process. Instead of attempting to tackle the whole project at once, it's much easier to take it piece by piece and move on when you're ready or when a specific section is properly working. This approach also enables developers to consider different methods for incorporating the requirements while ensuring the code remains maintainable and easy to understand.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The one part that I would revise would be the operating systems section. I believe that it is thorough and explains quite a bit, but it can always be improved to give a larger in-depth explanation.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The users' needs are extremely vital in the overall software design. During implementation, my goal was to consider factors such as cost, speed, memory usage, security, availability, and future implementation. These aspects are particularly crucial because the company aims to expand its user base across multiple platforms, which can be more demanding on the features required to run the program.

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I began by examining the problems that needed fixing. After analyzing them, I tackled each one individually until they ran without errors. It was crucial for me to ensure there were no issues before moving on to the next problem, which greatly helped in preventing overall code problems. Breaking down the tasks into manageable parts is a strategy I would definitely use again when designing a similar software application.
